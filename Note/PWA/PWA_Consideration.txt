Things to Considers

Topic No. 1 : Cache is not Updated.

Sometimes there might be too much caching, which cause the 
users to end up seeing older content until they 
close (reloading is not enough) their existing, open tabs.

Topic No. 2 : User is confused with PWA.

It is a good idea to notify the user if 
1. The app works off line when the internet connection is poor or unavailable.
2. When will the catch is updated (showing a "New content is available once existing tabs are closed." message). 

Topic No. 3 : Cache require HTTPS

Service worker require HTTPS.
PWA can work without HTTPS, but the Service worker (and cache) is not available.

Topic No. 4 : Turn the Cache off 

The service worker is only enabled in the production environment
It's recommended that you do not enable an offline-first service worker in a development environment
, as it can lead to more debugging difficulty.

Topic No. 5 : Debug the Cache

If you need to test your offline-first service worker locally
1. use an incognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.
2. npm run build // build the application
3. // run a standard http server from your build directory
4. create-react-app // give instructions for one way to test your production build locally and the deployment instructions. 

Topic No. 6 : Cache is working independently

By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any cross-origin traffic, 
like HTTP API requests, images, or embeds loaded from a different domain.
