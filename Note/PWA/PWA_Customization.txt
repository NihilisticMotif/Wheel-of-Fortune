## Customization

Starting with Create React App 4
you have full control over customizing the logic in this service worker, by creating your own src/service-worker.js file, or

customizing the one added by the cra-template-pwa (or cra-template-pwa-typescript) template. You can use additional modules from the Workbox project, add in a push notification library, or remove some of the default caching logic. The one requirement is that you keep self.__WB_MANIFEST somewhere in your file, as the Workbox compilation plugin checks for this value when generating a manifest of URLs to precache. 

Customizing server worker
1. src/service-worker.js
2. The one requirement is that you keep `self.__WB_MANIFEST` somewhere in your file

If you would prefer not to use precaching, you can assign `self.__WB_MANIFEST`
to a variable that will be ignored, like:

```
// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals
const ignored = self.__WB_MANIFEST;

// Your custom service worker code goes here.
```

## Progressive Web App Metadata

The default configuration includes a web app manifest located at `public/manifest.json`
The metadata in manifest.json determines what icons, names, 
and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.
